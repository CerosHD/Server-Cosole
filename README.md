# Server-Cosole
A simple php based Minecraft Server console for starting/stopping private Servers.
Before you Start you have to add the Sever.jar into the Server Folder. The current config is optimised for paper. if you use a diffrent version change the new rcon and query Port in the config.php. Also change the User in the config.php.
